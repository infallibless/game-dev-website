This feature is provided thanks to the og:title, og:description, and og:image tags.
- **Email Protection ->** The cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html link is an email address protection mechanism. This protection keeps the email address private in the web browser and renders it visible only to users.

the meta viewport setting provides an optimized view on mobile devices.
- **Components and Libraries ->** Functions such as displaying and filtering images are provided using libraries such as glightbox, swiper, and isotope-layout.
